    "Programming and software play a crucial role in aiding engineers in problem-solving tasks related to analyzing and designing structures like bridges using methods such as finite element analysis, free body diagrams, and truss analysis. These tools enable engineers to efficiently process complex mathematical calculations, simulate structural behaviors, and visualize results. Through programming, engineers can automate repetitive tasks, optimize algorithms, and implement sophisticated numerical methods, allowing them to explore various design scenarios rapidly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, to help us learn Python in the context of an Authentic Engineering problem, we will use a Python Module called AnaStruct to model and analyse different truss bridge designs. The theory and mathematics behind the kind of analysis performed by AnaStruct will be covered in later units such as EGB121 Engineering Mechananics."

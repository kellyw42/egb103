    "# EGB103 Assignment One - Wake Modeling and Control for Wind Farms\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming and software play a crucial role in aiding engineers in problem-solving tasks related to design, layout and control of wind turbines within large-scale wind farms using methods such as computational fluid dynamics and wake modeling. These tools enable engineers to efficiently process complex mathematical calculations, simulate dynamic behaviors, and visualize results. Through programming, engineers can automate repetitive tasks, implement sophisticated numerical methods and find optimal solutions to engineering design problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, to help us learn Python in the context of an Authentic Engineering problem, we will use a Python Module called FLORIS to try to optimally position and orient the wind turbines within a wind farm and steer their wakes to further optimize energy output given known local prevailing wind patterns. You may study the theory and mathematics behind the kind of analysis performed by Floris in later units such as EGB323 Fluid Mechananics."

    "\n",
    "The prevailing wind direction (and speed) will vary from day to day and even hour to hour. Wind turbines are normally designed to turn so that they are always facing towards the prevailing wind direction as this maximizes the wind velocity over the blades and so maximizes rotor rotation speed and therefore energy production. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the air has passed through the rotating blades of a wind turbine, its velocity will tend to decrease and the amount of turbulance will tend to increase. This wake affect can have a negative effect on other nearby wind turbines located down wind. The turbulance also causes variations in the mechanical loading on the blades which can cause long term structural fatique. Even at a distance of 500 metres, this wake effect is still very evident. We could place all of the wind turbines very far apart, so as to eliminate any wake effect, however that would require more land resources and also more cabling and time spent travelling between turbines during maintainance. The following diagram shows an example of these wakes when the wind is coming from the south west (as modeled and visualized by Floris).\n",

    "Normally a wind turbine is designed to turn so that it faces directly towards the current prevailing wind direction. However, it is also possible to instead point the turbine either slight to the left or right of where the wind is coming from. This is referred to as the ***yaw*** angle - the angle between the direction of the wind and the direction that the turbine is facing. This will have a negative effect on the power generated by that particular wind turbine, however, by changing the angle of the wind turbine relative to the wind, we can also change the direction of the *wake* caused by that turbine. In particular, we can actively ***steer*** the wake so as to try to avoid or lessen the wake affect on other nearby wind turbines which are downwind. So, the reduced negative wake effects on the downwind turbines can actually more than compensate for the slightly lower efficiency of the upwind turbine (which doesn't point directly towards the wind). Each wind turbine within the wind farm can be independently steered, either left or right any number of degrees. It is therefore a complex optimization problem to determine the best *yaw* angle for each of the turbines. And when the wind changes direction we have entirely new/different optimization problem which needs to be rapidly solved so as to maintain optimal efficiency of the wind farm as a whole.\n",

    "# Heuristic Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the perfect yaw angle for every turbine within a large wind farm is a computationally challenging problem, i.e. there are just so many different combinations of possible yaw angles that even a super fast computer able to perform billions of computation per second will still take too long to compute the optimal solution. There is little value in spending say 12 hours computing the optimal yaw angle for each turbine, because by then the wind may have shifted to a different direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For such computationally intensive calculations, it is common to use a heuristic, i.e. an simpler and faster algorithm that isn't guaranteed to always find the best possible solution, but will generally find pretty good solution. We will use such a heuristic to try to determine a yaw angle for each wind turbine that will maximize the overall energy production of the wind farm. The heuristic that we will use is referred to as a \"greedy\" heuristic. We start with a simple solution where every turbine has a yaw angle of zero degrees. i.e. it points directly towards the wind. We then consider each wind turbine one by one and for each turbine we will \"greedily\" choose the yaw angle for that wind turbine that yields the best overall energy production for the whole of the wind farm. We will then lock in that choice of yaw angle for that particular turbine (and will not reconsider it again) as we then move on to likewise greedily choose the locally optimal/best yaw angle for each of the remaining turbines. We say it is locally optimal meaning that given fixed yaw angles for all the other turbines, the one we select is best, even though some other combination of yaw angles for other turbines might produce an overall better solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are an infinite number of possible real-valued angles to choose from (even for just one turbine), so we will instea just explore a finite sample of possible yaw angles for the turbine in question. We will only explore yaw angles between $-20$ degrees and $+20$ degrees, but even if we explored in 1 degree increment, exploring $41$ different angles will still take a bit longer than we would like, so to speed up our experiment, we will only explore in increments of $4$ degrees (i.e. just $-20$, $-16$, $-12$, $-8$, $-4$, $0$, $4$, $8$, $12$, $16$ and $20$).\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore a particular angle for a our particular turbine, we will need to update the list of yaw angles and change the entry for just the turbine that we are focusing on.

In this way we can determine which of the various angles considered produces the best overall power.\n",

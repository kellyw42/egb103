    "Around the world, public transit agencies make data available about their services, routes, and stops via a standardized data format called <a href=\"https://gtfs.org/\">GTFS</a> (originally developed by Google). \n",
    "\n",
    "It has two parts: the static component contains information that changes rarely including locations of stops, routes and schedules. A new version of this static information is typically released every few months. Some agencies also provide a real-time component based on live GPS data from their buses, trains etc to provide up to the minute data about vehicle positions and arrival predictions - typically updated every 30 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical exercise will be based on only the static GTFS data.\n",
